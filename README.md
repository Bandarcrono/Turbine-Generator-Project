# Turbine-Generator-Project
Used Lorentz laws to use movement provided by the force of the wind in a helix turbine. Made in PLA and other components needed to develop the project. 
> This has a lot of physics involved , so if you want to know how it works, I reccomend to know how to integrate in a math problem and what does it mean in different situations.

In the previous image we can see that the maximum voltage is around 0.2 V that was checked with the laws by manual calcuation and because of the low force of the mangnets it did not provide a lot of voltage. And due to efficiency of the model, in reality the ideal data distribution graph should had been something like this:
